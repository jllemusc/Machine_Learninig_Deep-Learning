Moon-Shaped Data Generation and Visualization
Overview
This Python program generates moon-shaped synthetic data using scikit-learn's make_moons function. It creates datasets with varying levels of noise to simulate different complexities. The program then visualizes these datasets using matplotlib, providing insight into the challenges of moon-shaped data classification.

Data Generation
The program utilizes the make_moons function from scikit-learn to create moon-shaped datasets. It generates 185 samples with 2 features and introduces noise to the data. By adjusting the noise parameter, the program creates datasets with different levels of complexity, making it ideal for testing classification algorithms.

Data Visualization
The generated datasets are visualized in a set of plots, each representing a specific noise level. The x-axis and y-axis represent the features, and the points are colored and marked according to their respective classes. The plots provide a clear understanding of how noise affects the shape and separability of moon-shaped data.

Usage
This synthetic dataset is valuable for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms, especially those designed for non-linear data. Researchers and students can use this dataset to experiment with various noise levels and observe their impact on classification accuracy.

Important Note
While this dataset is generated for educational and experimental purposes, it does not represent any real-world scenario. When dealing with actual data, always consider the specific characteristics and challenges of the domain from which the data is collected.
