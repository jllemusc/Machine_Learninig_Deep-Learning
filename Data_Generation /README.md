<h1> Regression Data Generation and Visualization </h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
This Python program generates synthetic regression data using scikit-learn's make_regression function and visualizes it using matplotlib. The generated data consists of 175 samples with 2 features and a bias of 0.3. The program plots the data points, providing an illustrative view of the generated regression dataset.

<h2>Data Generation</h2>
The program utilizes the make_regression function from scikit-learn to create the dataset. It generates 175 samples with 2 features, ensuring a controlled bias of 0.3. This dataset simulates a regression scenario for analysis and modeling purposes.

<h2> Data Visualization </h2>
The generated data is plotted in a 2D graph, where the x-axis represents the features, and the y-axis represents the target values. Each green data point on the plot represents a sample generated by the make_regression function. The plot provides a clear visualization of the dataset's distribution and pattern.

<h2> Usage </h2>
This synthetic dataset is useful for various purposes, including testing regression algorithms, exploring regression concepts, and demonstrating data visualization techniques. It serves as a valuable tool for learning and experimenting with regression-related tasks.

<h2> Important Note </h2>
While this dataset is generated for educational and experimental purposes, it does not represent any real-world scenario. Always validate models and algorithms using real, domain-specific data before making any practical decisions based on the results.
