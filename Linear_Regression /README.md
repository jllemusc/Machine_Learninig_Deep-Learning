<h1> Linear Regression from Scratch </h1>


<h2> Overview </h2>

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of linear regression from scratch. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The program covers the basic concepts of linear regression, including model creation, loss calculation, and parameter optimization using gradient descent.

<h2> Code Overview </h2>

The code begins by generating synthetic data points and visualizes four different regression lines with varying offsets and slopes. It then implements gradient descent for linear regression, updating the parameters (b and w) iteratively to minimize the loss function. The program includes visualizations illustrating the evolution of the regression line and loss over multiple epochs.

<h2> Key Components </h2>

<ol>
<ul>Data Generation:</ul>

Random synthetic data points are generated for demonstration purposes.

<ul>Visualization:</ul>

The program provides visualizations of different regression lines and their evolution over epochs.

<ul> Gradient Descent:</ul>

The gradient_regression function implements gradient descent to optimize the regression parameters b (intercept) and w (slope).

<ul> Loss Calculation: </ul>

The loss function calculates the mean squared error (MSE) loss between predicted and actual values.

<ul> Prediction: </ul>

The prediction function predicts the target variable based on input features using the learned parameters.

<h2> Insights </h2>

<h3> Regression Line Evolution: </h3>


The visualizations show how the regression line gradually fits the data better with each epoch, demonstrating the learning process of the algorithm.
<h3> Impact of Learning Rate (Alpha):</h3>

Experimenting with different learning rates (alpha) showcases the importance of choosing an appropriate value for efficient convergence.
<h2> Usage </h2>

This program serves as a foundational guide for individuals learning about linear regression algorithms. It provides a hands-on understanding of the gradient descent optimization technique and its impact on the model's performance.

<h2> Important Note </h2>

Parameter Initialization:

The initial values of parameters (b and w) can significantly affect the convergence and performance of the model. Proper initialization is crucial for achieving accurate predictions.
