<h1> Iris Dataset Analysis</h1>
<h2> Overview</h2>

This Python program showcases an analysis of the famous Iris dataset using the scikit-learn library. The dataset consists of 150 instances, each representing an iris plant, categorized into three classes: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, and Iris-Virginica. The program explores various aspects of the dataset, including class names, feature names, target values, dataset description, and visualizations.

<h2>Dataset Description </h2>


Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of the three classes)
Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

<h2>Attributes:</h2>

Sepal length in cm

Sepal width in cm

Petal length in cm

Petal width in cm

<h3>Classes:</h3>

Iris-Setosa

Iris-Versicolour

Iris-Virginica

<h3>Code Overview </h3>

  
The program starts by loading the Iris dataset and extracting information such as target names, feature names, target values, dataset description, and data shape. It then generates scatter plots to visualize the relationships between sepal width, petal length, and petal width against sepal length.

<h2>Data Visualization </h2>


Plot 1: Scatter plot representing sepal width against sepal length for each iris class.
Plot 2: Scatter plot representing petal length against sepal length for each iris class.
Plot 3: Scatter plot representing petal width against sepal length for each iris class.

<h2>Dataset Insights </h2>


The provided visualizations offer insights into the relationships between sepal width, petal length, and petal width concerning sepal length for different iris classes. These visualizations help in understanding the characteristics that differentiate the three iris classes.
